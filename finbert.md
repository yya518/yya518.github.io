I maintain a **FinBERT** project with [Prof. Allen Huang](https://acct.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/acahuang). FinBERT, based on Google's [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html),  is a financial domain-specific pre-trained language model trained on 4.9 billion financial text.  The goal is to enhance financial NLP research and practice.

**Impact**: We have presented the FinBERT project to practitioners and regulators, including Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Society of Quantitative Analysts (SQA), AllianceBernstein, J.P. Morgan, and academic conferences in finance and accounting.

**Media coverage**: We also develop **[FinSent](https://cbsa.hkust.edu.hk/FinSent/)**, a browser-based financial sentiment analysis dashboard of U.S. and Hong Kong firms based on FinBERT. FinSent development is sponsored by [HKUST CBSA](https://cbsa.hkust.edu.hk/). FinSent receives media coverage by [Headline Daily](https://hd.stheadline.com/news/realtime/fin/2381746/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D-%E7%A7%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%A0%94%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D%E8%A7%A3%E8%AE%80%E6%A9%9FFinSent-%E6%B8%AC%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%B1%A4%E6%83%85%E7%B7%92-%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E6%9D%BF%E5%A1%8A%E8%87%AA%E6%88%91%E6%84%9F%E8%A6%BA%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5%E8%89%AF%E5%A5%BD), [Mingpao](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f/article/20221026/s00004/1666716245377/%e7%a7%91%e5%a4%a7%e6%8e%a8finsent-%e5%88%86%e6%9e%90%e9%87%91%e8%9e%8d%e6%83%85%e7%b7%92), [BastillePost](https://www.bastillepost.com/hongkong/article/11556694-%e7%a7%91%e5%a4%a7%e7%a0%94%e9%87%91%e8%9e%8d%e8%a7%a3%e8%ae%80%e6%a9%9ffinsent-%e6%b8%ac%e4%b8%8a%e5%b8%82%e7%ae%a1%e7%90%86%e5%b1%a4%e6%83%85%e7%b7%92-%e4%bb%8a%e5%b9%b4%e6%9c%89%e4%b8%80%e6%9d%bf?current_cat=5), and [Singtao](https://std.stheadline.com/realtime/article/1881746/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D-%E7%A7%91%E5%A4%A7%E7%A0%94%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D%E8%A7%A3%E8%AE%80%E6%A9%9FFinSent-%E6%B8%AC%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%B1%A4%E6%83%85%E7%B7%92-%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E6%9D%BF%E5%A1%8A%E8%87%AA%E6%88%91%E6%84%9F%E8%A6%BA%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5%E8%89%AF%E5%A5%BD).
