<p><br>I am a post-doc researcher in <a href = "http://business.illinois.edu/">College of Business</a> at <a href = "http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. <br><br>

<!--I am developing analytical methods for business intelligence. <br><br>-->
My research question is: how can firm/organization make better decision with machine learning and big data? <br><br>

I obtained Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at <a href = "http://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> in 2015. <br> <br>

During Ph.D., I was building efficient machine learning models for human language. <br><br>

I also worked as intern at IBM T.J.Watson Research and Amazon AWS. <br><br>

I jog and cycle.
