<br>
I will be joining the department of [Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management](http://www.bm.ust.hk/isom/index.html), School of Business and Management, at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](http://www.ust.hk/) as an assistant professor in July 2017. <br>

I am currently a post-doc researcher at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, College of Business. 
<!--My research question is: how can firm/organization make better decision with machine learning and big data? -->
My research interests are scalable machine learning, statistical inference, large-scale social network analysis and computational advertising. <br>

<!--I teach undergraduate database course at UIUC. <br><br>-->

I obtained Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Northwestern University in 2015. During Ph.D., I was building efficient machine learning models for human language. I received bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2009.<br>

I also worked as intern at IBM T.J.Watson Research and Amazon AWS. <br>
